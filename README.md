The CLI utility for generating a Cloud9 extension

To use:

```
$ npm install -g c9ext
$ c9ext
```

Starting up `c9ext` will prompt you for

1. What type of extension you want to create
2. What you want to name it

It will then load in template files and build your extension for you.

Original bin/c9ext code based off `express`. Thank you TJ!
